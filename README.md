# Tagged CV formatter

## Summary

This repository contains a small collection of tools to put together a CV in
PDF format that complies with both the requirements of ISO 14289-1:2014
(PDF/UA-1) and ISO 19005-2:2011 (PDF/A-2) at conformance level A.

The default formatting is inspired by the classic `moderncv` look and uses
Latin Modern fonts [as provided by GUST][GUST-LM]. The actual tagging
is performed by [iText 7](https://github.com/itext/itext7).
